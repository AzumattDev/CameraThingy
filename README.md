A mod for admins, gives 3 placeable "cameras" you can jump back to. Didn't like any of the mod names I could come up with, so I settled with this.

---
```
Only needs to be installed on the server and the admin's client. All clients do not need the mod. Useable by admins only.

It is recommended to be in god mod when using this, sometimes you can fall pretty far and die :D


Note: The keybinds are NOT configured by default. Make sure you set them. Each camera location is saved to the config file, so

you can jump right back to them the next time that you decide to.

> ## Installation Instructions
***You must have BepInEx installed correctly! I can not stress this enough.***

#### Windows (Steam)

1. Locate your game folder manually or start Steam client and :
    * Right click the Valheim game in your steam library
    * "Go to Manage" -> "Browse local files"
    * Steam should open your game folder
2. Extract the contents of the archive into the BepInEx\plugins folder.
3. Locate Azumatt.CameraThingy.cfg under BepInEx\config and configure the mod to your needs

#### Server

`Must be installed on both the client and the server for syncing to work properly.`

1. Locate your main folder manually and :
   a. Extract the contents of the archive into the BepInEx\plugins folder.
   b. Launch your game at least once to generate the config file needed if you haven't already done so.
   c. Locate Azumatt.CameraThingy.cfg under BepInEx\config on your machine and configure the mod to your needs
2. Reboot your server. All clients will now sync to the server's config file even if theirs differs. Config Manager mod
   changes will only change the client config, not what the server is enforcing.
